Fine-Tuning LLaMA-2 with QLORA 

**Project Overview**

This project aims to fine-tune the LLaMA-2 model using the Quantum Logic ORiented Approximation (QLORA) technique, specifically targeting the "mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k" dataset. QLORA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that modifies only a subset of the model's parameters, offering a balance between performance and efficiency. This approach is particularly beneficial for adapting large pre-trained models to specialized tasks or datasets with limited computational resources.

**Dataset**

The fine-tuning process utilizes the "mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k" dataset from Hugging Face Datasets.

**Objectives**

To explore the potential of QLORA for fine-tuning LLaMA-2, a leading language model, for improved efficiency and customization.
To assess the impact of QLORA-based fine-tuning on the model's performance on a specific task, using the "mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k" dataset as a case study.
To demonstrate a workflow for efficiently adapting large language models to specialized domains or tasks with minimal computational overhead.

**Methodology**

**Dataset Preparation:** Loaded and preprocessed the "mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k" dataset for compatibility with LLaMA-2's input requirements.
**Model Setup:** Selected the LLaMA-2 model for its robust capabilities in language understanding and generation. Integrated the QLORA fine-tuning technique into the model to enable efficient parameter updates.
**Fine-Tuning Process:** Conducted fine-tuning of the LLaMA-2 model using the QLORA approach, focusing on optimizing for the specific characteristics of the dataset.
**Evaluation:** Measured the fine-tuned model's performance using relevant metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of QLORA in enhancing model accuracy and efficiency on the targeted task.
